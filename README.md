This Python program utilizes the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model, a mathmetic model used in epidimiology to predict the spread of infectious diseases. 
The program takes a value for total population, number of susceptible, infected and recovered people to define a population. 
Then, it takes values for number of encounters per day, as well as quantifies contagiousness of the disease through a "probability of spread".
With all of this information collected, it then uses differential equations to predict and graph the spread of the disease, as well as generate a number table that breaks down the populations current state in regards to SIR model as well as the R0.
